---

### **Hackathon Theme**:  
**"Predicting and Preventing Heart Disease with Data Analytics"**

---

### **Objective**:
Participants will use the dataset to analyze key health indicators and build a predictive model to assess the likelihood of heart disease. The goal is to derive actionable insights and create tools to aid prevention.

---

### **Simple Problem Statements**:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Perform EDA to uncover patterns and trends in the dataset.
   - Visualize how factors like age, BMI, and physical activity relate to heart disease.
   - Deliver insights through clear and compelling visualizations.

2. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Build a classification model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on the given indicators.
   - Evaluate the model using metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.

3. **Risk Factor Identification**:
   - Identify the most critical factors contributing to heart disease using feature importance (e.g., SHAP values, correlation analysis).
   - Suggest strategies to mitigate risks.

---

### **Key Deliverables**:
1. Visualizations (charts, heatmaps) showing trends and relationships.
2. A trained predictive model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost).
3. A short presentation summarizing findings, model performance, and actionable insights.

---

### **Workflow**:
1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Provide participants with the dataset pre-cleaned or allow them to clean it as part of the task.
   - Ensure they understand the features:
     - `BMI`, `Smoking`, `AlcoholDrinking`, `Stroke`, `Diabetic`, `PhysicalActivity`, `SleepTime`, etc.
     - Target variable: `HeartDisease`.

2. **Suggested Tools**:
   - Python (with libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`).
   - Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab for development.

3. **Timeline**:
   - 11:00 AM â€“ Problem introduction and dataset briefing.
   - 11:30 AM â€“ Participants begin EDA and modeling.
   - 3:30 PM â€“ Submission of models and visualizations.
   - 4:00 PM â€“ Presentations (5 minutes per team).
   - 5:00 PM â€“ Winner announcement and wrap-up.

### **Judging Criteria**:
1. **Accuracy and Performance** (40%):
   - How well does the model predict heart disease?  
2. **Insights and Visualization** (30%):
   - Quality and clarity of visualizations and insights.  
3. **Innovation and Creativity** (20%):
   - Unique approaches to modeling or analysis.  
4. **Presentation** (10%):
   - How effectively are the findings communicated?

---

### **Outcome**:
Participants will:
- Learn to work with healthcare datasets.
- Build practical skills in data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.
- Gain experience presenting technical findings effectively.
